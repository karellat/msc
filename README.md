### 1.5T vs 3T	
It only takes basic math skills to figure out that a 3T MRI scanner has a field strength that is twice as powerful as a 1.5T MRI, but what does that really mean for an imaging professional? When you’re paying almost double for 3T, you should know what that means.

Across the United States and most of the world, 1.5T short-bore MRI remains the standard technology for MRI scanners. A 1.5T machine is faster than lower strength MRIs and is ideal for abdomens and chest MRIs. A 1.5T magnet creates more signal than a 1.2T magnet and there are a variety of options for what can be done with that extra signal.  You can use it to run shorter scan times, reduce possible motion distortion and create higher quality images.

Because the image quality of an MRI depends on signal and field strength, having double the signal strength allows a 3T MRI to provide extremely clear and vivid images. Additionally they can often be done faster, decreasing overall scan time. Both are of great value to the patient in terms of diagnosis and comfort.

3T is ideal for imaging small bones, breast MRI, musculoskeletal MRI, neurological MRI and vascular MRI, where the minute details are especially crucial to diagnosis. With that said, a 3T machine isn’t always the best for every kind of imaging. 3T has a higher likely hood of artifacts. An artifact is any object that appears in the image that is not in the original object. These can show up in MRI images as “flow” artifacts due to the movement of blood or fluid. A 3T machine also creates additional heat and more noise compared to a 1.5T, which can also be a challenge in some offices.
